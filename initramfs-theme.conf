# Theme configuration file for the rEFInd boot menu

# Hide user interface elements for personal preference or to increase
# security:
#  banner      - the rEFInd title banner (built-in or loaded via "banner")
#  label       - boot option text label in the menu
#  singleuser  - remove the submenu options to boot macOS in single-user
#                or verbose modes; affects ONLY macOS
#  safemode    - remove the submenu option to boot macOS in "safe mode"
#  hwtest      - the submenu option to run Apple's hardware test
#  arrows      - scroll arrows on the OS selection tag line
#  hints       - brief command summary in the menu
#  editor      - the options editor (+, F2, or Insert on boot options menu)
#  badges      - device-type badges for boot options
#  all         - all of the above
# Default is none of these (all elements active)

# Set the name of a subdirectory in which icons are stored. Icons must
# have the same names they have in the standard directory. The directory
# name is specified relative to the main rEFInd binary's directory. If
# an icon can't be found in the specified directory, an attempt is made
# to load it from the default directory; thus, you can replace just some
# icons in your own directory and rely on the default for others.
# Icon files may be in any supported format -- ICNS (*.icns), BMP (*.bmp),
# PNG (*.png), or JPEG (*.jpg or *.jpeg); however, rEFInd's BMP and JPEG
# implementations do not support transparency, which is highly desirable
# in icons.
# Default is "icons".
#
icons_dir themes/initramfs/icons

# Use a custom title banner instead of the rEFInd icon and name. The file
# path is relative to the directory where refind.efi is located. The color
# in the top left corner of the image is used as the background color
# for the menu screens. Currently uncompressed BMP images with color
# depths of 24, 8, 4 or 1 bits are supported, as well as PNG and JPEG
# images. (ICNS images can also be used, but ICNS has limitations that
# make it a poor choice for this purpose.) PNG and JPEG support is
# limited by the underlying libraries; some files, like progressive JPEGs,
# will not work.
#
banner themes/initramfs/banner.png

# Specify how to handle banners that aren't exactly the same as the screen
# size:
#  noscale     - Crop if too big, show with border if too small
#  fillscreen  - Fill the screen
# Default is noscale
#
banner_scale noscale

# Icon sizes. All icons are square, so just one value is specified. The
# big icons are used for OS selectors in the first row and the small
# icons are used for tools on the second row. Drive-type badges are 1/4
# the size of the big icons. Legal values are 32 and above. If the icon
# files do not hold icons of the proper size, the icons are scaled to
# the specified size. The default values are 48 and 128 for small and
# big icons, respectively.
#
small_icon_size 144
big_icon_size 256

# Custom images for the selection background. There is a big one (144 x 144)
# for the OS icons, and a small one (64 x 64) for the function icons in the
# second row. If only a small image is given, that one is also used for
# the big icons by stretching it in the middle. If only a big one is given,
# the built-in default will be used for the small icons. If an image other
# than the optimal size is specified, it will be scaled in a way that may
# be ugly.
#
# Like the banner option above, these options take a filename of an
# uncompressed BMP, PNG, JPEG, or ICNS image file with a color depth of
# 24, 8, 4, or 1 bits. The PNG or ICNS format is required if you need
# transparency support (to let you "see through" to a full-screen banner).

selection_big   themes/initramfs/selection-big.png
selection_small themes/initramfs/selection-small.png

# Set the font to be used for all textual displays in graphics mode.
# For best results, the font must be a PNG file with alpha channel
# transparency. It must contain ASCII characters 32-126 (space through
# tilde), inclusive, plus a glyph to be displayed in place of characters
# outside of this range, for a total of 96 glyphs. Only monospaced fonts
# are supported. Fonts may be of any size, although large fonts can
# produce display irregularities.
# The default is rEFInd's built-in font, Luxi Mono Regular 12 point.
